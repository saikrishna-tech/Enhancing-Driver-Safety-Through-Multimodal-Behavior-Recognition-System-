# Enhancing-Driver-Safety-Through-Multimodal-Behavior-Recognition-System:
•	Developed a multimodal driver behavior recognition system to improve road safety by predicting driver's emotional state, eye status (open/closed), and yawning.
•	Utilized Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for individual model development for each prediction task (emotion, eye status, yawning).
•	Integrated the individual models using a Haar Cascade algorithm to create a comprehensive driver behavior recognition system, achieving improved performance compared to individual models.
•	Implemented an alert mechanism with audio and visual cues: alarms for driver drowsiness and music for emotional regulation.
